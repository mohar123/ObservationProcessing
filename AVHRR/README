AVHRR processing 

AVHRR data started getting assimilated from 7 February 2012 although AVHRR
radiance data were available from late 1990. The instrument supplied radiance
data from NOAA-15, NOAA-16, NOAA-17, NOAA_18, NOAA-19, Metop-A and Metop-B
platforms (AM: N15, N17, MetOp-A, MetOp-B and PM: N16, N18, N19). 

Although AVHRR data were used in the GEOS operational systems since 2012, it 
was not included in MERRA-2. In order to use AVHRR data in the new reanalysis 
system, the data need to be accessed and processed from NOAA CLASS data 
system. Following section provides an overview of how to process the data for 
NASA MERRA21C reanalysis ingestion:; 

The processing scripts are found in : 

Bufr code to convert AVHRR Binary files to BUFR can be found in: 

Binary files are available from: https://www.aev.class.noaa.gov/saa/products/welcome;jsessionid=8062AD5B72C72BB6A7D2C5ADE96B5E94

The code to convert AVHRR files from NOAA-CLASS can be found below in:

A brief description of the process to convert AVHRR binary to BUFR can be found in : 

GEOSadas/src/Applications/GMAO_Etc/GMAObufr_util/ChangeLog 

Changes: 

The files make_avhrr_bufr.py and config_avhrr.py are used in processing the binary AVHRR files. make_avhrr_bfr.py is modified to use full path of the codes and scripts. The following lines are added/modified to process data from metop-a and metop-b. 

Look into the directory :  

    if which_satellite == 'metopA': 

        matches ='NSS.GHRR.M2.*D*.S*.E*' 

        am_or_pm='AVCSAM' 

        check_satid = 1 

    if which_satellite == 'metopB': 

        matches ='NSS.GHRR.M1.*D*.S*.E*' 

        am_or_pm='AVCSAM' 

        check_satid = 1         

    if check_satid == 0: 

        print 'Check satellite ID: N15, N16, N17, N18,  N19, MetOpA and MetOpB!' 

Use the command : python make_avhrr_bufr.py to create bufr files of AVHRR.
