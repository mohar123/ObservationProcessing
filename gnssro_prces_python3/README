Using the Python3 for concatenation of multiple BUFR files into one for a
single synoptic time:

The script to process the files is:
test_process_km_yy.sh

and the important part of the script is :

    ./cdaac2ncep.py ${date_dir} 6 km

where "km" directory needs to be in the same path as the script ./test_process_km_yy.sh

The BUFR files are store in 
/discover/nobackup/projects/gmao/obsdev/mchattop/GPSROdata/python3/km/yyyy.dom/
(day of the month)

cdaac2ncep.py is symlinked to newpy3_cdaac2ncep.py
